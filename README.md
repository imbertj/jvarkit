## Documentation

Documentation is available at: [https://jvarkit.readthedocs.io/](https://jvarkit.readthedocs.io/)

## Download

A pre-compiled jar is available at [https://uncloud.univ-nantes.fr/index.php/s/4sL77oWR2BFzSBH](https://uncloud.univ-nantes.fr/index.php/s/4sL77oWR2BFzSBH) . 

## Compilation

Since 2023, most tools (but not all) are now packaged into one application `jvarkit.jar`. Tools that were executed like `java -jar toolname.jar` are now executed as `java -jar jvarkit.jar toolname`. The documentation is not always up to date on this point.

See the documentation at [https://jvarkit.readthedocs.io/](https://jvarkit.readthedocs.io/).

## Conda / Bioconda

A conda package created by [DrYak](https://github.com/DrYak)  is available at [https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/jvarkit/README.html](https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/jvarkit/README.html)

## Containers

jvarkit is available as a **Singularity** container under [https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/](https://depot.galaxyproject.org/singularity/) .
GUI/Swing applications might not work.
